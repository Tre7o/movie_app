# Movie App

An application that uses retrofit to fetch movie data from the TMDB API, displaying the data in a recycler view.

The application is built using the Model, View, ViewModel(MVVM) architecture which separates the logic of the application from its UI. 

# What users can do
1. On launching the application, users can see the latest movies
2. Users can also search for movies
3. They can select movies to get more details about that movie
